 * todo cuantos stores pongo, como gestiono el foreign share?
 * <p/>
 * un store general para descargas de grupo, con un foreign share asociado
 * los permisos especificos a cada fichero se tendran que gestionar a un nivel superior
 * un store para ficheros compartidos con usuarios especificos
 * <p/>
 * y un unico store y el se apagna?
 * <p/>
 * mejor dar aqui tb la funcionalidad de stores, y que el decida como lo usa
 * <p/>
 * poder agnadir y eliminar stores locales y foraneos, y especificar el store en la descarga
 * <p/>
 * A lo mejor podria dar hecho uno general, y si al descargar no especifica store, tira de ese. SI
 * <p/>
 * Al descargar, dejar que especifica path final (si null, lo escojo yo y se lo doy en el informe final)
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * lo guay seria poder compartir ficheros con todos, con grupos, o con uno
